- Data Engineer Responsibilities

    - Extracting data from different types of formats and databases (Python and SQL)
    - Transforming and modeling data according to business domain
    - Loading data into data warehouses or other structures
    - Infrastructure (Linux, cloud, entire installations)



- Popular Tools

    - Programming Languages
        - SQL
        - Python
        - JVM languages like Java and Scala

    - Databases
        - Proprietary SqlServer and Oracle
        - Open Source PostgreSQL and MySQL

    - Data Warehousing Databases
        - Amazon RedShift (Columnar)
        - Google BigQuery (Columnar)
        - Apache Cassandra (Columnar)
        - ElasticSearch (also Solr and Lucene)

    - Data Processing Engines
        - Apache Spark
        - Apache Storm
        - Apache Flink and Samza

    - Data Pipeline
        - Simple crontab
        - Airflow
        - Nifi
        - Luigi
        


- Apache Airflow

    - Workflow management platform built by Airbnb
    - Composed of a web server, scheduler, metastore, queueing system, and executors
    - Uses DAGs to manage dependencies
    - Most popular solution



- Apache NiFi

    - Framework for building data engineering pipelines, built by NSA
    - Write processors in Jython, Clojure, Scala, Groovy
    - Much fancier GUI than Airflow
    - Also uses DAGs to manage dependencies
