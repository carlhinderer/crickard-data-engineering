- Backpressure

    - We may have some steps in our pipeline that take a lot longer than others, but it doesn't
        make sense to dump data into the queue faster than it can be processed.

      The ability of a system to slow down sending data to the queue when it is full is called 
        'backpressure'.



- NiFi Deployment Strategies

    - Simplest = Keep DEV, TEST, and PROD environments all on the same canvas.  Can just copy 
        changes over from one environment to the next.  This could work for very small
        installations only.  The entire canvas is saved in the NiFi registry.


    - Middle = Create a separate production environment.  The NiFi registry is moved to a
        separate machine, and the production environment can pull the latest changes during
        releases.  This way you can store separate environment variables for the Production
        environment.


    - Most Advanced = Use a separate registry for each environment.  An administrator can move
        changes through the environments before deploying to production.
